Hi!

My name is Sam and I am currently a student at PRIME academy. I am learning a lot of new material and facing the challenges that come along with it. After Prime I will begin my career as a software engineer, where my learning and the challenges will only continue! For that, I am incredibly excited as the challenges are what makes this such a rewarding career. I am really excited to get started in this field!

Sam
